## Sorting an array

### Problem 912 
This problem requires us to sort an array without using built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity while minimizing space complexity.
From class we learned that there are various O(nlog(n)) time algorithms and stability is required in this case so Mergesort was my chosen implementation
